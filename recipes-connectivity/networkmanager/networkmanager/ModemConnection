# Number to dial when establishing a PPP data session

# The GPRS Access Point Name specifying the APN used when
# establishing a data session with the GSM-based network. 
# The APN often determines how the user will be billed for 
# their network usage and whether the user has access to 
# the Internet or just a provider-specific walled-garden, 
# so it is important to use the correct APN for the user's 
# mobile broadband plan. The APN may only be composed of
#the characters a-z, 0-9, ., and - per GSM 03.60 Section 14.9.

# The Network ID (GSM LAI format, ie MCC-MNC) to force
# specific network registration. If the Network ID is

# direct roaming control of the device is not otherwise possible.
